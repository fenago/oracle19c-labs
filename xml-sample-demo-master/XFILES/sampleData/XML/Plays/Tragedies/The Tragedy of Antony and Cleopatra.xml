        <LINE>We, ignorant of ourselves,</LINE>

        <LINE>I shall do well:</LINE>
        <LINE>The people love me, and the sea is mine;</LINE>
        <LINE>My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope</LINE>
        <LINE>Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony</LINE>
        <LINE>In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make</LINE>
        <LINE>No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where</LINE>
        <LINE>He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,</LINE>
        <LINE>Of both is flatter&apos;d; but he neither loves,</LINE>

        <LINE>Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,</LINE>

        <LINE>This is most certain that I shall deliver:</LINE>

        <LINE>Expected: since he went from Egypt &apos;tis</LINE>

        <LINE>I could have given less matter</LINE>

        <LINE>This amorous surfeiter would have donn&apos;d his helm</LINE>
        <LINE>For such a petty war: his soldiership</LINE>
        <LINE>Is twice the other twain: but let us rear</LINE>
        <LINE>The higher our opinion, that our stirring</LINE>
        <LINE>Can from the lap of Egypt&apos;s widow pluck</LINE>
        <LINE>The ne&apos;er-lust-wearied Antony.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>

        <SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I cannot hope</LINE>

        <LINE>His wife that&apos;s dead did trespasses to Caesar;</LINE>
        <LINE>His brother warr&apos;d upon him; although, I think,</LINE>
        <LINE>Not moved by Antony.</LINE>

        <LINE>Were&apos;t not that we stand up against them all,</LINE>
        <LINE>&apos;Twere pregnant they should square between</LINE>
        <LINE>themselves;</LINE>
        <LINE>For they have entertained cause enough</LINE>
        <LINE>To draw their swords: but how the fear of us</LINE>
        <LINE>May cement their divisions and bind up</LINE>
        <LINE>The petty difference, we yet not know.</LINE>
        <LINE>Be&apos;t as our gods will have&apos;t! It only stands</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>No more than my residing here at Rome</LINE>
        <LINE>Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there</LINE>
        <LINE>Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt</LINE>
        <LINE>Might be my question.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>

        <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>You may be pleased to catch at mine intent</LINE>
        <LINE>By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother</LINE>
        <LINE>Made wars upon me; and their contestation</LINE>
        <LINE>Was theme for you, you were the word of war.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>You do mistake your business; my brother never</LINE>
        <LINE>Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;</LINE>
        <LINE>And have my learning from some true reports,</LINE>
        <LINE>That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather</LINE>
        <LINE>Discredit my authority with yours;</LINE>
        <LINE>And make the wars alike against my stomach,</LINE>
        <LINE>Having alike your cause? Of this my letters</LINE>
        <LINE>Before did satisfy you. If you&apos;ll patch a quarrel,</LINE>
        <LINE>As matter whole you have not to make it with,</LINE>
        <LINE>It must not be with this.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>You praise yourself</LINE>

      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Not so, not so;</LINE>
        <LINE>I know you could not lack, I am certain on&apos;t,</LINE>
        <LINE>Very necessity of this thought, that I,</LINE>
        <LINE>Your partner in the cause &apos;gainst which he fought,</LINE>
        <LINE>Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars</LINE>
        <LINE>Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,</LINE>
        <LINE>I would you had her spirit in such another:</LINE>
        <LINE>The third o&apos; the world is yours; which with a snaffle</LINE>
        <LINE>You may pace easy, but not such a wife.</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>

        <SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar</LINE>
        <LINE>Made out of her impatience, which not wanted</LINE>
        <LINE>Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant</LINE>
        <LINE>Did you too much disquiet: for that you must</LINE>
        <LINE>But say, I could not help it.</LINE>

      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I wrote to you</LINE>
        <LINE>When rioting in Alexandria; you</LINE>
        <LINE>Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts</LINE>
        <LINE>Did gibe my missive out of audience.</LINE>

      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Sir,</LINE>
        <LINE>He fell upon me ere admitted: then</LINE>
        <LINE>Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want</LINE>
        <LINE>Of what I was i&apos; the morning: but next day</LINE>
        <LINE>I told him of myself; which was as much</LINE>
        <LINE>As to have ask&apos;d him pardon. Let this fellow</LINE>
        <LINE>Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,</LINE>
        <LINE>Out of our question wipe him.</LINE>

        <LINE>Neglected, rather;</LINE>

        <LINE>Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power</LINE>
        <LINE>Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,</LINE>
        <LINE>To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;</LINE>
        <LINE>For which myself, the ignorant motive, do</LINE>
        <LINE>So far ask pardon as befits mine honour</LINE>

        <LINE>The barge she sat in, like a burnish&apos;d throne,</LINE>

        <LINE>Purple the sails, and so perfumed that</LINE>
        <LINE>The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made</LINE>
        <LINE>The water which they beat to follow faster,</LINE>
        <LINE>As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,</LINE>
        <LINE>It beggar&apos;d all description: she did lie</LINE>

        <LINE>O&apos;er-picturing that Venus where we see</LINE>
        <LINE>The fancy outwork nature: on each side her</LINE>
        <LINE>Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,</LINE>
        <LINE>With divers-colour&apos;d fans, whose wind did seem</LINE>
        <LINE>To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,</LINE>

        <LINE>Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,</LINE>
        <LINE>That yarely frame the office. From the barge</LINE>
        <LINE>A strange invisible perfume hits the sense</LINE>

        <LINE>Her people out upon her; and Antony,</LINE>

        <LINE>Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,</LINE>
