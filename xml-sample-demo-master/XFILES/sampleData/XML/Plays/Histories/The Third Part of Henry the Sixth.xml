        <LINE>While we pursued the horsemen of the north,</LINE>
        <LINE>He slily stole away and left his men:</LINE>
        <LINE>Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,</LINE>
        <LINE>Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,</LINE>
        <LINE>Cheer&apos;d up the drooping army; and himself,</LINE>
        <LINE>Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,</LINE>

        <LINE>Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,</LINE>
        <LINE>I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.</LINE>
        <LINE>This is the palace of the fearful king,</LINE>

      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>

        <SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,</LINE>

        <LINE>Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.</LINE>
        <LINE>I&apos;ll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,</LINE>
        <LINE>Even in the chair of state: belike he means,</LINE>
        <LINE>Back&apos;d by the power of Warwick, that false peer,</LINE>
        <LINE>To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.</LINE>
        <LINE>Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>EDWARD</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I wonder how our princely father &apos;scaped,</LINE>
        <LINE>Or whether he be &apos;scaped away or no</LINE>
        <LINE>From Clifford&apos;s and Northumberland&apos;s pursuit:</LINE>
        <LINE>Had he been ta&apos;en, we should have heard the news;</LINE>
        <LINE>Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;</LINE>
        <LINE>Or had he &apos;scaped, methinks we should have heard</LINE>
        <LINE>The happy tidings of his good escape.</LINE>

        <LINE>I cannot joy, until I be resolved</LINE>
        <LINE>Where our right valiant father is become.</LINE>
        <LINE>I saw him in the battle range about;</LINE>
        <LINE>And watch&apos;d him how he singled Clifford forth.</LINE>
        <LINE>Methought he bore him in the thickest troop</LINE>
        <LINE>As doth a lion in a herd of neat;</LINE>
        <LINE>Or as a bear, encompass&apos;d round with dogs,</LINE>
        <LINE>Who having pinch&apos;d a few and made them cry,</LINE>
        <LINE>The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.</LINE>
        <LINE>So fared our father with his enemies;</LINE>
        <LINE>So fled his enemies my warlike father:</LINE>
        <LINE>Methinks, &apos;tis prize enough to be his son.</LINE>

        <LINE>See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,</LINE>

        <LINE>That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,</LINE>
        <LINE>Each one already blazing by our meeds,</LINE>
        <LINE>Should notwithstanding join our lights together</LINE>
        <LINE>And over-shine the earth as this the world.</LINE>
        <LINE>Whate&apos;er it bodes, henceforward will I bear</LINE>

      </SPEECH>

        <LINE>Environed he was with many foes,</LINE>
        <LINE>And stood against them, as the hope of Troy</LINE>
        <LINE>Against the Greeks that would have enter&apos;d Troy.</LINE>
        <LINE>But Hercules himself must yield to odds;</LINE>
        <LINE>And many strokes, though with a little axe,</LINE>
        <LINE>Hew down and fell the hardest-timber&apos;d oak.</LINE>
        <LINE>By many hands your father was subdued;</LINE>
        <LINE>But only slaughter&apos;d by the ireful arm</LINE>
        <LINE>Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,</LINE>
        <LINE>Who crown&apos;d the gracious duke in high despite,</LINE>
        <LINE>Laugh&apos;d in his face; and when with grief he wept,</LINE>
        <LINE>The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks</LINE>
        <LINE>A napkin steeped in the harmless blood</LINE>
        <LINE>Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:</LINE>
        <LINE>And after many scorns, many foul taunts,</LINE>
        <LINE>They took his head, and on the gates of York</LINE>
        <LINE>They set the same; and there it doth remain,</LINE>
        <LINE>The saddest spectacle that e&apos;er I view&apos;d.</LINE>

        <LINE>Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,</LINE>

        <LINE>O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain</LINE>
        <LINE>The flower of Europe for his chivalry;</LINE>
        <LINE>And treacherously hast thou vanquish&apos;d him,</LINE>
        <LINE>For hand to hand he would have vanquish&apos;d thee.</LINE>
        <LINE>Now my soul&apos;s palace is become a prison:</LINE>
        <LINE>Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body</LINE>
        <LINE>Might in the ground be closed up in rest!</LINE>
        <LINE>For never henceforth shall I joy again,</LINE>
        <LINE>Never, O never shall I see more joy!</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>RICHARD</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I cannot weep; for all my body&apos;s moisture</LINE>
        <LINE>Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:</LINE>
        <LINE>Nor can my tongue unload my heart&apos;s great burthen;</LINE>
        <LINE>For selfsame wind that I should speak withal</LINE>
        <LINE>Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,</LINE>
        <LINE>And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.</LINE>
        <LINE>To weep is to make less the depth of grief:</LINE>
        <LINE>Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me</LINE>
        <LINE>Richard, I bear thy name; I&apos;ll venge thy death,</LINE>
        <LINE>Or die renowned by attempting it.</LINE>

      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>RICHARD</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount</LINE>
        <LINE>Our baleful news, and at each word&apos;s deliverance</LINE>
        <LINE>Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,</LINE>
        <LINE>The words would add more anguish than the wounds.</LINE>
        <LINE>O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>EDWARD</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which held three dearly as his soul&apos;s redemption,</LINE>
        <LINE>Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Ten days ago I drown&apos;d these news in tears;</LINE>
        <LINE>And now, to add more measure to your woes,</LINE>
        <LINE>I come to tell you things sith then befall&apos;n.</LINE>
        <LINE>After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,</LINE>
        <LINE>Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,</LINE>
        <LINE>Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,</LINE>
        <LINE>Were brought me of your loss and his depart.</LINE>
        <LINE>I, then in London keeper of the king,</LINE>
        <LINE>Muster&apos;d my soldiers, gather&apos;d flocks of friends,</LINE>
        <LINE>And very well appointed, as I thought,</LINE>
        <LINE>March&apos;d toward Saint Alban&apos;s to intercept the queen,</LINE>
        <LINE>Bearing the king in my behalf along;</LINE>
        <LINE>For by my scouts I was advertised</LINE>
        <LINE>That she was coming with a full intent</LINE>
        <LINE>To dash our late decree in parliament</LINE>
        <LINE>Touching King Henry&apos;s oath and your succession.</LINE>
        <LINE>Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban&apos;s met</LINE>
        <LINE>Our battles join&apos;d, and both sides fiercely fought:</LINE>
        <LINE>But whether &apos;twas the coldness of the king,</LINE>
        <LINE>Who look&apos;d full gently on his warlike queen,</LINE>
        <LINE>That robb&apos;d my soldiers of their heated spleen;</LINE>
        <LINE>Or whether &apos;twas report of her success;</LINE>
        <LINE>Or more than common fear of Clifford&apos;s rigour,</LINE>
        <LINE>Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</LINE>
        <LINE>I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,</LINE>
        <LINE>Their weapons like to lightning came and went;</LINE>
        <LINE>Our soldiers&apos;, like the night-owl&apos;s lazy flight,</LINE>
        <LINE>Or like an idle thresher with a flail,</LINE>
        <LINE>Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.</LINE>
        <LINE>I cheer&apos;d them up with justice of our cause,</LINE>
        <LINE>With promise of high pay and great rewards:</LINE>
        <LINE>But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,</LINE>
        <LINE>And we in them no hope to win the day;</LINE>
        <LINE>So that we fled; the king unto the queen;</LINE>
        <LINE>Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,</LINE>
        <LINE>In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:</LINE>
        <LINE>For in the marches here we heard you were,</LINE>
        <LINE>Making another head to fight again.</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;</LINE>
        <LINE>And for your brother, he was lately sent</LINE>
        <LINE>From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,</LINE>
        <LINE>With aid of soldiers to this needful war.</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;</LINE>
        <LINE>For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine</LINE>
        <LINE>Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry&apos;s head,</LINE>
        <LINE>And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,</LINE>
        <LINE>Were he as famous and as bold in war</LINE>
        <LINE>As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>RICHARD</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:</LINE>
        <LINE>&apos;Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.</LINE>
        <LINE>But in this troublous time what&apos;s to be done?</LINE>
        <LINE>Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,</LINE>
        <LINE>And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,</LINE>
        <LINE>Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?</LINE>
        <LINE>Or shall we on the helmets of our foes</LINE>
        <LINE>Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?</LINE>
        <LINE>If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;</LINE>
        <LINE>And therefore comes my brother Montague.</LINE>
        <LINE>Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,</LINE>
        <LINE>With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,</LINE>
        <LINE>And of their feather many more proud birds,</LINE>
        <LINE>Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.</LINE>
        <LINE>He swore consent to your succession,</LINE>
        <LINE>His oath enrolled in the parliament;</LINE>
        <LINE>And now to London all the crew are gone,</LINE>
        <LINE>To frustrate both his oath and what beside</LINE>
        <LINE>May make against the house of Lancaster.</LINE>
        <LINE>Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:</LINE>
        <LINE>Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,</LINE>
        <LINE>With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,</LINE>
        <LINE>Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,</LINE>
        <LINE>Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,</LINE>
        <LINE>Why, Via! to London will we march amain,</LINE>
        <LINE>And once again bestride our foaming steeds,</LINE>
        <LINE>And once again cry &apos;Charge upon our foes!&apos;</LINE>

        <LINE>Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>This battle fares like to the morning&apos;s war,</LINE>
        <LINE>When dying clouds contend with growing light,</LINE>
        <LINE>What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,</LINE>
        <LINE>Can neither call it perfect day nor night.</LINE>
        <LINE>Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea</LINE>
        <LINE>Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;</LINE>
        <LINE>Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea</LINE>
        <LINE>Forced to retire by fury of the wind:</LINE>
        <LINE>Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;</LINE>
        <LINE>Now one the better, then another best;</LINE>
        <LINE>Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,</LINE>
        <LINE>Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:</LINE>
        <LINE>So is the equal of this fell war.</LINE>
        <LINE>Here on this molehill will I sit me down.</LINE>
        <LINE>To whom God will, there be the victory!</LINE>
        <LINE>For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,</LINE>
        <LINE>Have chid me from the battle; swearing both</LINE>
        <LINE>They prosper best of all when I am thence.</LINE>
        <LINE>Would I were dead! if God&apos;s good will were so;</LINE>
        <LINE>For what is in this world but grief and woe?</LINE>
        <LINE>O God! methinks it were a happy life,</LINE>
        <LINE>To be no better than a homely swain;</LINE>
        <LINE>To sit upon a hill, as I do now,</LINE>
        <LINE>To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,</LINE>
        <LINE>Thereby to see the minutes how they run,</LINE>
        <LINE>How many make the hour full complete;</LINE>
        <LINE>How many hours bring about the day;</LINE>
        <LINE>How many days will finish up the year;</LINE>
        <LINE>How many years a mortal man may live.</LINE>
        <LINE>When this is known, then to divide the times:</LINE>
        <LINE>So many hours must I tend my flock;</LINE>
        <LINE>So many hours must I take my rest;</LINE>
        <LINE>So many hours must I contemplate;</LINE>
        <LINE>So many hours must I sport myself;</LINE>
        <LINE>So many days my ewes have been with young;</LINE>
        <LINE>So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:</LINE>
        <LINE>So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:</LINE>
        <LINE>So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,</LINE>
        <LINE>Pass&apos;d over to the end they were created,</LINE>
        <LINE>Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.</LINE>
        <LINE>Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!</LINE>
        <LINE>Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade</LINE>
        <LINE>To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,</LINE>
        <LINE>Than doth a rich embroider&apos;d canopy</LINE>
        <LINE>To kings that fear their subjects&apos; treachery?</LINE>
        <LINE>O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.</LINE>
        <LINE>And to conclude, the shepherd&apos;s homely curds,</LINE>
        <LINE>His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.</LINE>
        <LINE>His wonted sleep under a fresh tree&apos;s shade,</LINE>
        <LINE>All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,</LINE>
        <LINE>Is far beyond a prince&apos;s delicates,</LINE>
        <LINE>His viands sparkling in a golden cup,</LINE>
        <LINE>His body couched in a curious bed,</LINE>
        <LINE>When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.</LINE>

        <LINE>My love and fear glued many friends to thee;</LINE>
        <LINE>And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.</LINE>
        <LINE>Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,</LINE>

        <LINE>Thy burning car never had scorch&apos;d the earth!</LINE>

        <LINE>I and ten thousand in this luckless realm</LINE>
        <LINE>Had left no mourning widows for our death;</LINE>

        <LINE>Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;</LINE>
        <LINE>No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:</LINE>
        <LINE>The foe is merciless, and will not pity;</LINE>
        <LINE>For at their hands I have deserved no pity.</LINE>
        <LINE>The air hath got into my deadly wounds,</LINE>

        <LINE>But set his murdering knife unto the root</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>My queen and son are gone to France for aid;</LINE>
        <LINE>And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick</LINE>
        <LINE>Is thither gone, to crave the French king&apos;s sister</LINE>
        <LINE>To wife for Edward: if this news be true,</LINE>
        <LINE>Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;</LINE>
        <LINE>For Warwick is a subtle orator,</LINE>
        <LINE>And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.</LINE>
        <LINE>By this account then Margaret may win him;</LINE>
        <LINE>For she&apos;s a woman to be pitied much:</LINE>
        <LINE>Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;</LINE>
        <LINE>Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;</LINE>
        <LINE>The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;</LINE>
        <LINE>And Nero will be tainted with remorse,</LINE>
        <LINE>To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.</LINE>
        <LINE>Ay, but she&apos;s come to beg, Warwick to give;</LINE>
        <LINE>She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,</LINE>
        <LINE>He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.</LINE>
        <LINE>She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;</LINE>
        <LINE>He smiles, and says his Edward is install&apos;d;</LINE>
        <LINE>That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;</LINE>
        <LINE>Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,</LINE>
        <LINE>Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,</LINE>
        <LINE>And in conclusion wins the king from her,</LINE>
        <LINE>With promise of his sister, and what else,</LINE>
        <LINE>To strengthen and support King Edward&apos;s place.</LINE>
        <LINE>O Margaret, thus &apos;twill be; and thou, poor soul,</LINE>

        <LINE>More than I seem, and less than I was born to:</LINE>

        <LINE>My crown is in my heart, not on my head;</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>First Keeper</SPEAKER>

        <LINE>Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!</LINE>
        <LINE>Look, as I blow this feather from my face,</LINE>
        <LINE>And as the air blows it to me again,</LINE>
        <LINE>Obeying with my wind when I do blow,</LINE>
        <LINE>And yielding to another when it blows,</LINE>
        <LINE>Commanded always by the greater gust;</LINE>
        <LINE>Such is the lightness of you common men.</LINE>
        <LINE>But do not break your oaths; for of that sin</LINE>
        <LINE>My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.</LINE>
        <LINE>Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;</LINE>

        <LINE>And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,</LINE>
        <LINE>Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,</LINE>
        <LINE>And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,</LINE>
        <LINE>Saying, he&apos;ll lade it dry to have his way:</LINE>
        <LINE>So do I wish the crown, being so far off;</LINE>
        <LINE>And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;</LINE>

        <LINE>Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;</LINE>
        <LINE>What other pleasure can the world afford?</LINE>
        <LINE>I&apos;ll make my heaven in a lady&apos;s lap,</LINE>
        <LINE>And deck my body in gay ornaments,</LINE>
        <LINE>And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.</LINE>
        <LINE>O miserable thought! and more unlikely</LINE>
        <LINE>Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!</LINE>
        <LINE>Why, love forswore me in my mother&apos;s womb:</LINE>
        <LINE>And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,</LINE>
        <LINE>She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,</LINE>
        <LINE>To shrink mine arm up like a wither&apos;d shrub;</LINE>
        <LINE>To make an envious mountain on my back,</LINE>
        <LINE>Where sits deformity to mock my body;</LINE>
        <LINE>To shape my legs of an unequal size;</LINE>
        <LINE>To disproportion me in every part,</LINE>
        <LINE>Like to a chaos, or an unlick&apos;d bear-whelp</LINE>
        <LINE>That carries no impression like the dam.</LINE>
        <LINE>And am I then a man to be beloved?</LINE>
        <LINE>O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!</LINE>
        <LINE>Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,</LINE>
        <LINE>But to command, to cheque, to o&apos;erbear such</LINE>
        <LINE>As are of better person than myself,</LINE>
        <LINE>I&apos;ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,</LINE>
        <LINE>And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,</LINE>
        <LINE>Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head</LINE>
        <LINE>Be round impaled with a glorious crown.</LINE>
        <LINE>And yet I know not how to get the crown,</LINE>
        <LINE>For many lives stand between me and home:</LINE>
        <LINE>And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,</LINE>
        <LINE>That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,</LINE>
        <LINE>Seeking a way and straying from the way;</LINE>
        <LINE>Not knowing how to find the open air,</LINE>
        <LINE>But toiling desperately to find it out,--</LINE>
        <LINE>Torment myself to catch the English crown:</LINE>
        <LINE>And from that torment I will free myself,</LINE>
        <LINE>Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.</LINE>
        <LINE>Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,</LINE>
        <LINE>And cry &apos;Content&apos; to that which grieves my heart,</LINE>
        <LINE>And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,</LINE>
        <LINE>And frame my face to all occasions.</LINE>
        <LINE>I&apos;ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;</LINE>
        <LINE>I&apos;ll slay more gazers than the basilisk;</LINE>
        <LINE>I&apos;ll play the orator as well as Nestor,</LINE>
        <LINE>Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,</LINE>
        <LINE>And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.</LINE>
        <LINE>I can add colours to the chameleon,</LINE>
        <LINE>Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,</LINE>
        <LINE>And set the murderous Machiavel to school.</LINE>
        <LINE>Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?</LINE>
        <LINE>Tut, were it farther off, I&apos;ll pluck it down.</LINE>

        <LINE>No more my king, for he dishonours me,</LINE>

        <LINE>Did I forget that by the house of York</LINE>
        <LINE>My father came untimely to his death?</LINE>
        <LINE>Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?</LINE>
        <LINE>Did I impale him with the regal crown?</LINE>

        <LINE>Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis</LINE>

      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,</LINE>
        <LINE>Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Yet, to have join&apos;d with France in such alliance</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,</LINE>

        <LINE>Unto the brother of your loving bride;</LINE>
        <LINE>She better would have fitted me or Clarence:</LINE>

        <LINE>And now what rests but that we spend the time</LINE>
        <LINE>With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,</LINE>
        <LINE>Such as befits the pleasure of the court?</LINE>
        <LINE>Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!</LINE>
